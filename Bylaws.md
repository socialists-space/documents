# Bylaws of the Space Coast, FL Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America

## Article I: Name.
The name of the Local Chapter shall be the Space Coast, FL Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). DSA is a not-for-profit corporation.

## Article II: Purpose.
The Space Coast Local Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America is organized exclusively to promote social welfare. It seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means/resources of production are democratically and socially controlled.

DSA rejects capitalism, an economic order based on oppression, private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, gender, disability or sexual orientation, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo.

DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources, production, and economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded. It is committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade and industrial unions, women's groups, political parties, and other formations—recognizing these as essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state. It is committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central.

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision. In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broader Left. In the long run, we hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality on the stolen land we now know as the United States. Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society. This class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.

## Article III: Membership.

### Section 1. Membership.
Members of the Space Coast DSA (collectively, the membership) will be those individuals who are in good standing with National DSA, who reside, study, and/or work in Brevard and Indian River Counties, FL.  Individuals may not be members of the Local Chapter without being members of national DSA. It will be the responsibility of members to:
1. approve policies and guidelines for the operation of the Local Chapter
2. to elect the Local Chapter's Steering Committee
3. to elect delegates to the national, regional, and state conventions
4. to vote on matters related to local and national policy
5. to make recommendations on issues, policies, activities, and ongoing efforts pursuant to local or national political goals, and

### Section 2. Resignation and Expulsion.
Any member may resign from the Local Chapter and become an at-large member of National DSA by sending an email or letter of resignation to both the Communications Facilitator of the Local Chapter and to National DSA.

If a member in good standing is:
1. found to be consistently engaging in undemocratic, disruptive behavior; or
2. found to have violated the Local Chapter's Code of Conduct; or
3. found to be in substantial disagreement with the principles or policies of national DSA
4. found to have engaged in anti-union activities or
5. found to be under the discipline of any democratic centralist organization,
the Local Chapter may vote to suspend (as defined in the Code of Conduct) or expel them from the Local Chapter.

In order for such a finding to be made, another DSA member must formally prefer written charges against the member in question to the Local Chapter Steering Committee, which shall set the date of a Local Chapter meeting for deliberations on the charges. The member in question must receive a copy of the written charges and notice of the meeting a minimum of fourteen (14) days before that meeting takes place, as well as an opportunity to speak before members prior to a determining vote.

Suspension or expulsion of a member shall require a two-thirds vote at a Meeting. A suspended or expelled member may appeal to the National Political Committee of DSA.

### Section 3. Voluntary Donations.
As mandated by the national Bylaws, the Local Chapter may establish a Local Chapter pledge system of voluntary donations for its members. The payment or nonpayment of a Local Chapter donation may not deny membership or the privileges or the powers of membership to any individual that is in good standing of National DSA, including voting or for holding Local Chapter office. Members may not face retaliatory action for the nonpayment of donations or preferential treatment for paying local donations (see the Code of Conduct). Donations shall be kept anonymous to the greatest practical extent.

### Section 4. Privacy concerns.
Care will be taken to protect the privacy of each member's contact information. Protected information includes member email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing or physical addresses. Protected information may only be shared to members outside the Steering Committee on a need-to-know basis to facilitate communication to members. Anyone with access to protected information must agree to use it only to further goals of the Local Chapter.

## Article IV. Local Chapter Meetings.

### Section 1. General Meeting.
The Local Chapter will hold a minimum of one General Meeting annually, at a date, time, and location agreed upon by the Steering Committee within one month of the anniversary of the prior General Meeting. At least fourteen (14) days before the General Meeting, all members of the Local Chapter will be sent notice of the meeting along with a proposed agenda. Notice may be sent by electronic means. The General Meeting will elect Local Chapter officers, receive reports of the activities of the Local Chapter, set the political direction and policies of the Local Chapter and its programming for the coming year, and may adopt an annual budget. The General Meeting shall be considered the “Annual Meeting” where local or state law may require such and may coincide with a Regular Meeting.

### Section 2. Regular Meetings.
The Local Chapter will hold Regular Meetings monthly, the time and place of which shall be set in a schedule published and distributed by the Local Chapter Steering Committee. The Regular Meetings will set Local Chapter policy and work priorities and may include political discussion or education sessions. The Local Chapter Steering Committee will propose the agenda for Regular Meetings. Any member in good standing can submit business to the Steering Committee for an upcoming Regular Meeting at least fourteen (14) days before.

### Section 3. Special Meetings.
The Local Chapter Steering Committee or the largest number between five members or twenty-five percent (25%) of the membership may call a Special Meeting of the Local Chapter on at least seven days' notice when an urgent and important matter requires deliberation. No matters other than those listed in the meeting notice may be brought to or raised from the floor at a Special Meeting.

### Section 4. Quorum.
A quorum of 60% of the average attendance of the last three Meetings is required for General, Regular, or Special Meetings (each, when they meet quorum, is a Meeting) to transact business. Should a meeting fail to meet quorum in two consecutive occasions, the Steering Committee shall be permitted to modify this formulation, subject to a majority vote of the members present at the next planned Regular Meeting. Any quorum set may not fall below 10% of the membership or six members, whichever is higher.

### Section 5. Accessibility.
Upon request, members may participate in Meetings by, or through the use of, any means of communication allowing all participants to simultaneously or sequentially communicate with one other, such as teleconference, video-conference, or other available technology. This includes voice votes. Any participant in a Meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting.

A Member in good standing (Proxy) who is present at a Meeting may hold up signed proxy cards from other non-present Members in good standing. The Proxy must vote in line with each non-present Member's directions as written on their proxy card. Despite being deemed present by attending electronically, non-physically present members may avail themselves of proxies for purposes of voting by secret ballot.

### Section 6. Online Voting.
The Steering Committee may decide, or shall decide at the request of 15% of the membership making a proposal, to hold an online vote on any issue. Members shall be eligible to vote so long as they are members in good standing as of the start of the online voting period following close of debate. At least 20%, or 80% of the average response rate of the prior three (3) online communications, whichever shall be higher, of members in good standing must vote or the vote will be considered invalid for lack of a quorum.

The Steering Committee shall announce all online votes to the membership by email and all other reasonable means. There shall be a 7-day period for debate following the announcement. At the close of debate, there shall be a 7-day voting period during which any eligible member may vote. The Steering Committee may propose a shorter time-frame for discussion or voting, but if any member objects to the shortened time frame, it may not be shortened. No motions to call the question or extend debate will be allowed, and no amendments will be allowed. However, at any time after the start of debate, any eligible member may motion to table the proposal, either temporarily or permanently, with a simple majority vote.

All voting thresholds for a passing vote shall be the same as if the vote were held at an in-person meeting. Votes to abstain will count toward the quorum. A vote can become binding before the close of the 48-hour voting period if the number of votes in favor or against has surpassed the threshold that would be required if all eligible votes were cast.

### Section 7. Decision-Making Authority.
The membership, meeting in a General, Regular or Special Meeting, shall constitute the highest decision-making body of the Local Chapter. All decisions, policies, agendas, statements, and other items of business decided at these Meetings are binding over any other body of the Local Chapter. Meetings may overturn the decisions of prior Meetings, but no other body may.

## Article V. Local Chapter Officers: Powers and Duties.

### Section 1. Officers and Terms.
The officers of the Local Chapter will be two (2) Co-Chairs, Communications Facilitator, Treasurer and Committee Organizers. The term of office will be one year, and shall run from February 1st to January 31st or until their successors are elected. Officers are eligible for re-election to serve up to two consecutive terms unless no other candidate is nominated.

### Section 2. Vacancies.
In the event of a vacancy in any Local Chapter office, a special election for the remainder of the vacant member's term shall be triggered within thirty (30) days after the opening of the vacancy if regular elections are not to be held within sixty (60) days of the vacancy. Special elections may coincide with a Regular Meeting.

### Section 3. Co-Chairs.
The Co-Chairs will preside over Local Chapter and Steering Committee meetings or will appoint a substitute to assume the powers and duties of the presiding officer as specified in Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised.

The Co-Chairs will be the official public spokespersons for the Local Chapter and will facilitate such actions and policies as the Local Chapter's general welfare may demand.

The Co-Chairs will also be responsible for coordinating the day-to-day operations and political work of the Local Chapters branches and committees.

The Co-Chairs will report to Local Chapter Regular Meetings on the business of the Steering Committee Meetings, at which time a copy of the minutes of those meetings will be available for inspection.

The Co-Chairs should not both be men. Only one co-chair may be male at a time unless no non-male members run for the office.

### Section 4. Communications Facilitator.
The Communications Facilitator will be responsible for answering all correspondence and queries of the Local Chapter, for maintaining an up-to-date membership list of the Local Chapter, distributing copies of minutes and agendas to each Steering Committee member, and assuring that corporate records are maintained for legal status. They will ensure effective communication with national DSA, including the filing of any amendment to these bylaws. They will temporarily assume the responsibilities of the Co-Chair if neither Co-Chair is able to do so.

The Communications Facilitator will be responsible also for the taking of minutes of all Local Chapter and Steering Committee Meetings, the collection and maintenance of Committee charters, notes, and meeting minutes, and making copies available to members promptly. They shall have custody of these documents, and of the resolutions, reports and other official records of the Local Chapter, and shall transfer official records in good condition to their successor. Official records shall include the documents necessary for continued functioning of the Local Chapter, such as member lists, and all documentation necessary to provide, to the general membership, transparent accountability of Local Chapter actions and decisions to the greatest reasonable extent.

When Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised is used, the Communications Facilitator will have the same powers as a Secretary.

### Section 5. Treasurer.
The Treasurer will be responsible for the funds and financial records of the Local Chapter. All funds collected by the Local Chapter will be turned over to the Treasurer, who shall deposit them in a bank account under the name of the Local Chapter. In cooperation with the Communications Facilitator, the Treasurer will be responsible for ensuring that membership dues are paid up-to-date. The Treasurer will chair a Finance Committee if one is established; will prepare the annual Local Chapter budget and deliver the Local Chapter financial report to the General Meeting of the Local Chapter, as well as periodic progress reports as requested by the Steering Committee of the Local Chapter; will provide basic information to National DSA related to the operations and finances of the Local Chapter as necessary.

### Section 6. Committee Organizers.
See Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3 for duties and election of Committee Organizers.

### Section 7. Additional Duties.
The Local Chapter Steering Committee may assign additional temporary duties to an officer of the Local Chapter, so long as such assignments do not conflict with the designation of responsibilities outlined in these Bylaws.

### Section 8. Diversity.
The Local Chapter does not plan on establishing strict numeric standards which the leadership demographics have to meet, as we do not intend to force people to take organizational duties they cannot meet. However, as socialists, we want the Steering Committee to reflect the people they are organizing, which includes people of different races, ethnicities, genders, sexualities, religious beliefs, nationalities, etc, so that we work towards building a better world for everyone.

## Article VI. Steering Committee.

### Section 1. Composition.
The Local Chapter Steering Committee will be composed of the officers of the Local Chapter, and the chair(s) of any Local Chapter branches.

### Section 2. Duties.
The Steering Committee shall administer the affairs of the Local Chapter and coordinate the implementation of the decisions of any Meetings, and shall prepare an agenda proposal for each Meeting. It shall have the power to receive reports of any committee or Branch and advise thereon, to call Special Meetings of the Local Chapter, and to act on any matter within their mandate that requires immediate and urgent action. The Steering Committee is the highest decision-making body of the Local Chapter between Meetings, and is subordinate to the general membership.

The Local Chapter Steering Committee will be responsible for establishing program activities for the Local Chapter, for proposing guidelines and policies that will subsequently be voted on by the Local Chapter's members, and for acting on the organization's behalf between Local Chapter meetings.

### Section 3. Meetings.
The meetings of the Steering Committee will be held at such intervals as may be determined by a prior Steering Committee Meeting or by consultation between a majority of the members of the Steering Committee. All members of the Steering Committee must (ordinarily) be given four (4) days oral, written, or electronic notice of regular Steering Committee Meetings; a 24-hour notice may be given under special emergency circumstances. Notice requirements may be waived only by unanimous approval. Steering Committee Meetings may be held electronically by any means acceptable to all the members of the Steering Committee. Any member of the Local Chapter in good standing may observe meetings of the Steering Committee and the Steering Committee shall allow for a question and answer period and a comment period. However, the Steering Committee may hold executive sessions if 60% of its members vote to do so in order to discuss member discipline or security matters.

The Steering Committee may govern itself through any reasonable decision-making process, including development of meeting rules and norms or decisions by consensus. When there is a dispute over how decisions shall be made, Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised​ shall govern.

### Section 4. Quorum.
There is no quorum for Steering Committee decisions. However, no Steering Committee decision shall be valid without a majority of the total number of Steering Committee members voting in assent, and notice as specified in Section 3.

### Section 5. Board of Directors
For the purposes of meeting the requirements of local and state incorporation laws, the Local Chapter shall have a “Board of Directors” consisting of members of the Steering Committee assigned for the purpose as logical and required by law. (For example, if the law requires a “Secretary” then the Local Chapter's Communications Facilitator is a logical fit.) Officers of the Steering Committee so appointed do not gain any new or additional powers or responsibilities except those strictly required by law.

## Article VII. Branches.

### Section 1. Definition.
A Branch is a subgroup of the Local Chapter formed to facilitate participation in the Local Chapter in a logistically convenient way. Branches may be defined by geography, membership in an institution, or language. It is expected that Branches be able to carry out as much of as many of the pillar functions of the Local Chapter for their members as necessary for their logistical purposes. The chair of each Branch shall hold membership on the Steering Committee. Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) chapters within the geographic area defined by a DSA Local Chapter may affiliate as a Branch of that Local Chapter, in which case the local YDSA chapter may send a representative in good standing to the Local Chapter Steering Committee.

### Section 2. Formation.
Any group of at least five (5) Members of the Local Chapter, in good standing, may request to be recognized as a Branch. They must apply to the Steering Committee in writing. Their application must include the names of its members; a description of purposes, functions, and membership criteria; and any other information unanimously deemed necessary by the Steering Committee. A majority vote of the general membership at a Meeting shall be required to establish a Branch. YDSA chapters need only show proof of being an officially recognized chapter of YDSA as part of a generic request to be recognized as a Branch of the Local Chapter, subject to approval by a majority vote of the general membership at a Meeting. Sections 3 and 4 below shall not be required of YDSA chapter-Branches.

### Section 3. Structure, Membership, and Elections
Each Branch shall have its own bylaws explicitly defining its purpose, functions, and membership criteria in detail. Such bylaws may establish the Branch's methods and structures as long as they do not violate these bylaws or the constitution and bylaws of National DSA. Each Branch shall be responsible for electing its leadership and Steering Committee representation. Every Local member may vote in only two Branch elections for Steering Committee representatives, although they may be a member of as many Branches as they wish. Branch leaders shall be responsible for scheduling and organizing meetings and actions of their Branch. In the event of a vacancy of a Branch leader or Steering Committee representative, the Branch may vote to elect new leadership or Steering Committee representation. Each Branch shall maintain an official membership list.

### Section 4. Dissolution
A Branch may have its status revoked by a majority vote of the membership at a Meeting. A Branch may also choose to dissolve itself by means specified in its Branch Bylaws. In the event that a Branch chooses to split into several new Branches, each new Branch must apply for membership through the same method as creating any Branch, although the Steering Committee may choose to waive requirements for certain documentation if it is identical to the prior or parent Branch.

## Article VIII. Committees.

### Section 1. Committee Formation.
The Chapter may establish committees to organize around specific functions for the chapter or external campaigns. Members who wish to form a committee must submit a proposed written charter to the Steering Committee that includes a group name; a mission statement and objectives; if necessary, a proposed budget that shall include any planned donation drives; a list of at least five prospective members signed or affirmed by those members; a statement of whether the proposed committee is to be a standing committee of indefinite duration or a temporary committee to expire at a certain time or upon the occurrence of a specified event; whether membership in the committee is to be open to all members in good standing or limited, and if membership is to be limited, the means by which members will be selected. A proposed committee shall be chartered and created with the approval of a majority of the votes cast at an General, Regular, or Special Meeting. Charters for proposed committees must be distributed to the membership by email or other electronic means at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting, and may not conflict with these Bylaws or with the charters of other active committees.

### Section 2. Membership and Election of Committee Leadership.
Membership in a committee shall be open to all Local Chapter members in good standing unless the committee's charter limits membership, in which case the terms of the charter shall control. Committees shall maintain an official membership list. After the committee is created, but by no later than the committee's second meeting, the committee shall hold elections for a Committee Organizer using ranked-choice voting. Terms shall be for either six months or one year at the committee members' choosing, and incumbents may stand for reelection.

### Section 3. Duties and Responsibilities.
The members of a committee are responsible for executing their respective body's strategy in fulfillment of its objectives. The Committee Organizer is responsible for organizing their respective body's members, running meetings, acting as liaisons to the Steering Committee, and serving as the committee's points of contact to the membership. Committees must keep official records of meeting dates, number of attendees, and meeting notes, which must be made available to the membership.

When a committee's proposed activities relate to the mission of another committee, the co-chairs of that committee shall be notified. Should a dispute arise between two or more committees that cannot be resolved between them, it shall be resolved at a Meeting.

A committee's activities shall be reviewed by the Steering Committee at its meetings, and meeting minutes and other committee documentation, as well as all financial receipts and statements, shall be kept up to date with the Local Chapter's Communications Facilitator and Treasurer respectively. Committees shall report on their activities to the membership at the General Meeting or more frequently at Regular or Special Meetings as necessary.

### Section 4. Modification and Dissolution.
Committees may be dissolved or may amend their charters, including changes to the committee's budget, with the approval of a majority of the votes cast at a General, Regular, or Special Meeting. Notice of a proposed committee dissolution or an amendment to a committee's charter must be given to the membership by email or other electronic means at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting.

Additionally, committees that are chartered as temporary committees for a limited time or particular purpose shall dissolve automatically upon the expiration of the certain time or the occurrence of the particular event specified in their charter.

Upon dissolution, the member(s) maintaining custody of the committee's records shall provide copies of those records to the Communications Facilitator.

### Section 5. Subcommittees.
A committee or subcommittee may choose to delegate some portion of its mission statements or objectives to a subcommittee. A subcommittee so created must select its members, form a charter to be voted on by the committee above it, elect officers, and coordinate with other committees in accordance with Sections 1 through 3 (above). The creation, chartering, and modification of a subcommittee shall require only the approval of the committee creating it, however all budgetary decisions requiring Chapter funds held by the Treasurer must be approved by a majority of the votes cast at a General, Regular, or Special Meeting.

The Committee Organizer of a subcommittee shall serve as regular members of the committee above them to coordinate the committee and subcommittees work, and shall provide to that committee up to date records of their and all subsequent subcommittee's minutes, actions, financial, and other necessary documentation.

## Article IX. Caucuses.
Any group of 5 or more members may form a caucus by submitting a proposal to the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee must recognize all such groups as caucuses as long as they align with the Chapter's purpose (see Article II). Such recognition shall not be construed as having authority to officially act on behalf of the Chapter. Caucuses must be permitted to announce their meetings using the communication channels the chapter uses to announce Meetings of the chapter. Caucuses may dissolve themselves by notifying the Steering Committee.

## Article X. Delegates & Nominees to National, Regional, and State Bodies.

### Section 1. Convention.
Local Chapter delegates and alternates to any National, Regional, or State Convention will be elected by members in good standing of the Local Chapter of the DSA. Elections for Convention delegation shall be held according to the convention schedule.

### Section 2. Committees.
In the event that a national, regional, or state-level committee is being formed and the responsible body asks local chapters for nominees to serve on that committee, the Local Chapter Steering Committee shall notify all members in good standing and request volunteers. The names of all those who volunteer shall be forwarded to the appropriate contact for consideration, or if a limited number of nominees are requested, an election shall be held.

## Article XI. Elections, Nominations and Recalls.

### Section 1. Nominations Committee.
A three-person Nominations Committee shall be established at least one month prior to every election by vote of a Regular Meeting. It shall solicit and receive nominations for the positions to be elected.

## Article XII. Code of Conduct
The Local Chapter will establish, by vote of a Meeting, a code of conduct (Code of Conduct) that outlines the boundaries of acceptable behavior by members of the Local Chapter and describes options for censure of members, including suspension or expulsion. The Code of Conduct shall be made available to all members of the Local Chapter. Amendments to the Code of Conduct must be approved at a Meeting.

## Article XIII. Amendments.
Proposed amendments to these Bylaws must be made by written resolution, endorsed by five (5) members of the Local Chapter, and submitted to the Steering Committee 31 days in advance of a General or Regular Meeting. The Steering Committee shall take at most fourteen (14) days to process the amendment and must then provide the Local Chapter membership written or electronic notice of the proposed amendments. The amendment must be approved by a 2/3 supermajority vote at a General or Regular Meeting.

## Article XIV. Rules of the Local Chapter.

### Section 1. Rules.
The Rules contained in Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised, shall govern this Local Chapter in cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with these Bylaws. Consensus decision-making is desirable where feasible, but meetings must submit to Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised upon the request of a member.

### Section 2. Action Out of Order.
Any action taken by an officer or member of the Local Chapter in contravention of these Bylaws is null and void.

## Article XV. Dissolution.
In the event of the dissolution of this Local Chapter, all remaining funds and assets are to be released to National DSA or a neighboring DSA chapter. If both this Chapter and National DSA are being dissolved, then all remaining funds and assets are to be released to such other organizations that are organized exclusively for the promotion of social welfare and that will operate to further the common good and general welfare of the community included in this Chapter's stated boundaries. The final action of the Chapter shall be to vote on selecting the organization(s) to which funds will be disbursed.

## Article XVI. Prohibited Activity
The Space Coast Democratic Socialists of America shall not engage in activity prohibited by the IRS guidelines established for 501 (c) 4 organizations or similar rules or laws established by the state of Florida, nor shall the Local Chapter engage in any activity prohibited by resolutions adopted by DSA's National Convention or DSA's National Political Committee.
